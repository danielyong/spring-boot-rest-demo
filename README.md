## Sample Spring Boot Project 

A very simple and crude CRUD with Spring Boot, with with different implementation of selecting and updating data.
Some place uses CRUD repository while others uses raw SQL with JDBC templates
Basic authentication check when accessing certain endpoints

UI is practically non existent as I am not really a front end developer, I build backend stuffs

## Setting up your project

Run docker compose build, or setup to a PostgreSQL instance manually
